 # NeuroEvolutionary Self Driving Car
A self driving car equipped with a Neural Network that is evolved using a Genetic Algorithm.
This project is an implementation of Self Driving Simulated cars that use a Neural Network by providing the immediate sorrounding proximity as input and the output to guide them through the sorrounding.

## Requirements
To run you would require the (Java Runtime Environment)[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html]
